# Distributed_Data_Analytics_Labs

## This repository includes implementation of different machine learning algorithms on distributed programming enviroments like MPI, TensorFlow,Pytorch etc.

* Exercise 0 : Linear Regression through exact form and Pandas and Numpy exercises.

* Exercise 1 : Parallel matrix operations like multiplication, addition and average with MPI

* Exercise 2 : Data cleaning ,text tokenization, calculation of term frequency and term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency in a corpus of 20_news_group dataset using MPI.

* Exercise 3 :Implementing K-mean clustering algorithm on 20_news_group dataset's TF-IDF calculated in execerise 2 using MPI.
